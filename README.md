# OECD Better Life Index Data Analysis

### Project Overview
This project aims to showcase my ability to transform datasets using both Excel and 
Python, and to create clear, user-friendly visualizations that allow for actionable 
insights. The dataset used in this project is from the OECD Better Life Index, which
measures well-being across several areas in OECD countries. More information about 
the OECD Better Life Index can be found <a href="https://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/">here.

Community, Education, Environment, Civic Engagement, Health, Life Satisfaction, 
Safety, and Work-Life Balance.
